       "<b>The Philadelphia Phillies are a professional baseball team based in Philadelphia. They compete in Major League Baseball as a member of the National League East division. The team has a long history, dating back to their establishment in 1883. They have won two World Series championships, eight National League pennants, and have made 15 playoff appearances. The Phillies have played over 21,000 games and have won over 10,000 of them. They have played at several stadiums in Philadelphia, including Recreation Park, Baker Bowl, Shibe Park (renamed Connie Mack Stadium), Veterans Stadium, and currently, Citizens Bank Park. The team has had both periods of success and periods of futility throughout their history. They have a rivalry with the Washington Nationals, which dates back to the Nationals' original tenure as the Montreal Expos. The Phillies also had a historical rivalry with the Philadelphia Athletics, known as the City Series. The team has retired eight numbers and has a Wall of Fame to honor former players. They have had notable players in their history, including Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt. In recent years, the Phillies have had ups and downs, with periods of success and periods of rebuilding.</b>"
